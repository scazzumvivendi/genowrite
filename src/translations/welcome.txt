Hi! Have you seen the readme? No? I hope you take a look at it, I'm too lazy to write also here all the features!

You can tell me if you liked this joke at https://github.com/thewritingdude/genowrite (so you can read the README)

But since you're here and read all of this, I can tell you some useful shortcuts to work more quickly.

(Windows):
- Ctrl + d: new note
- Ctrl + f: focus search field
- Ctrl + ↑: switch to note above
- Ctrl + ↓: switch to note below
- Ctrl + Space: open sidebar when collapsed
- Ctrl + e: export note
- Ctrl + i: import note

(Mac):
- {Alt} + d: new note
- {Alt} + f: focus search field
- {Alt} + ↑: switch to note above
- {Alt} + ↓: switch to note below
- {Alt} + Space: open sidebar when collapsed

Now press the + button and start writing!
